#BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode

Xcode plugin to [uncrustify](http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net) code in Xcode. 

## Requirements

Tested with Xcode 4.6+ on OS X 10.7 or higher.

## Installation

* Build the Xcode project. The plug-in will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. 

* Relaunch Xcode.

To uninstall, just remove the plugin from `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins` and restart Xcode.

## How does it work?

* Use the menu `Edit > Uncrustify Selected Files` to uncrustify the selected items in the project navigator.

* Use the menu `Edit > Uncrustify Active File` to uncrustify the source file actually opened in the editor. 

* Use the menu `Edit > Uncrustify Selected Lines` to uncrustify the selected source code (multiple selection is supported). The selection is automatically extended in full lines. If the selection is empty, it uses the line under the cursor.

PS: Modifications are recorded in the undo. So undo reverts the modifications.

You can create keyboard shortcuts for the menu items in the [Keyboard Preferences](http://support.apple.com/kb/ph3957) of OS X System Preferences.


## How to customize the uncrustify configuration?

By default, the plugin uses the configuration file `uncrustify.cfg` found in the bundle.

To customize the configuration, copy the file `uncrustify.cfg` or your own to:

1. `uncrustify.cfg` in the same directory of your `.xcodeproj` file or
2. `~/.uncrustifyconfig` or
3. `~/uncrustify.cfg`

### Using UncrustifyX

A more easy way to edit the configuration is to use the Mac appplication [UncrustifyX](https://github.com/ryanmaxwell/UncrustifyX). 

Once UncrustifyX is installed, the plugin will add a menu item `Open with UncrustifyX` to open the actual source code and configuration in UncrustifyX.

## Notes

After uncrustification, the plugin:

* performs a syntax-aware indenting if checked in the Xcode preferences (Preferences > Text Editing > Indentation > Syntax-aware indenting).

* Trims trailing whitespaces and white-only lines if checked in the Xcode preferences (Preferences > Text Editing > Editing).
